				<h4>MineCraft</h4>
					<p> Minecraft is my favorite game. Minecraft is a building block world. It is currently No. 1 on the App Store Charts. The only thing I would change about Minecraft is that you are only allowed 5 players in your game at once. I would personally recommend this to imaginative players and people who like building things.</p>
				<h4>Club Penguin</h4>
					<p>Club Penguin is a fun and funny game. Take care of your Puffles and go on missions. Dress up, have fun, and be awesome!</p>
				<h4>The Escapists</h4>
					<p></p>
				<h4>Moshi Monsters</h4>
					<p>Moshi Monsters is an interactive game where you have to take care of your creatures. You will have fun, play games, and collect Moshlings. This game is really fun, and I advise you to go on it now!</p>
				<h4>Sims</h4>
					<p>Sims is a “real game”. Basically a simulation of real life. It is currently on the top of the App Store charts. The only thing I would change is the fact you have to go on computer to get download somethings. I personally recommend this to anyone who is creative</p>
				<h4>Geometry</h4>
					<p>So-Many-SHAPES!Geometry is interesting and fun. It is currently No. 2 of the App Store charts. The only thing I would change is that it costs money. I recommend this to classrooms and people that really like geometry.</p>
