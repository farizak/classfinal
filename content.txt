Gaming Review
By Zaylie GoreMinecraft
My favorite game



Minecraft is a building block world. It is currently No. 1 on the App Store Charts. The only thing I would change about Minecraft is that you are only allowed 5 players in your game at once. I would personally recommend this to imaginative players and people who like building things.

Sims
A realization game

Sims is a simulation of real life. It is currently No.  of App Store charts. The only thing I would change is the fact you have to go on computer to get somethings. I personally recommend this to anyone who is creative.

Geometry Dash
So…Many…SHAPES!!!!!

Geometry Dash is a game where you…you guessed it! Geometry. It is currently No. 2 of the App Store charts. The only thing I would change is that it costs money. I recommend this to classrooms and people that really like geometry.
